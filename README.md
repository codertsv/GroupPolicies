# CodeRtsv Group Policies
Welcome to CodeRtsv, the JCU Townsville R user group! We are a group of semi, somewhat, and diehard R writing scientists who use R (and other languages) to solve a diverse set of problems in our respective fields. This group is really about sharing knowledge, helping others, and creating a collaborative environment for all; regardless of experience or background. In this repo you'll find some policies detailing our guiding philosophy and code of conduct. A core idea of this group is open source/open science, if there's something you don't agree or would like to change (e.g. typoes!) please submit a RP and we can improve together.
